## How to Contribute to this Project

The [common contribution guidelines](https://github.com/glutanimate/docs/blob/master/anki/add-ons/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute-to-my-anki-add-ons) also apply here for the most part. Some additions that are specific to `aab`:

- **Python version support**: In order to support Anki 2.0 builds, it's important that your changes maintain backwards compatibility with Python 2.7
- **Coding style conventions**: Instead of the more idiosyncratic rules used by Anki add-ons, `aab` follows the guidelines employed by the [`black` project](https://github.com/psf/black)

Thanks!
