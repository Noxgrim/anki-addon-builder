## How to Contribute to this Project

The [common contribution guidelines](https://github.com/glutanimate/docs/blob/master/anki/add-ons/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute-to-my-anki-add-ons) for my add-ons should also serve as good guideline for this project (as long as you ignore the sections that are specific to Anki's codebase, e.g. the special coding style conventions).

Thanks!
